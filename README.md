# Finding-Similar-Itemsets
This was my project for Big Data course in my university.
3 Steps fot finding similar items:
1. Shingling: Converting a document into a set representation (Boolean vector)
2. Min-Hashing: Converting large sets to short signatures, while preserving similarity
3. Locality-Sensitive Hashing: Focusing on pairs of signatures likely to be from similar documents: candidate pairs
